It was a two day workshop which covered ML at basic and intermediate levels. On the first day attendees were introduced to the concept of ML and its applications and also the opportunities it beholds. We also conducted fun tutorials to explain ML in simple terms. Neural networks and tensor flow were covered on the first day. The second day mainly focused on the math behind ML, hence topics like regression, vectorization, linear algebra, linear regression were familiarised. By the end of the second day attendees were asked to code on Google Colabs and get a hands on experience of ML. In order to review the understanding of participants a fun interactive quiz called Kahoot was conducted which assessed their knowledge for the day. Winners of the quiz were given goodies. This workshop received an overwhelming response from the participants and we are looking forward to having another ML workshop later in the month of November.",
